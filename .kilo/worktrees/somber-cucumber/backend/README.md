# FKAMS Backend

Node.js + Express + MySQL API for Forever King Academy Management System.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Create the database and tables:

```powershell
mysql -u root -p < schema.sql
```

After the base schema, apply later migrations in order:

```powershell
mysql -u root -p fkams < migrations/002_admission_profiles.sql
mysql -u root -p fkams < migrations/003_publications.sql
mysql -u root -p fkams < migrations/006_password_reset.sql
mysql -u root -p fkams < migrations/007_extend_tests_schema.sql
mysql -u root -p fkams < migrations/008_class_subjects.sql
mysql -u root -p fkams < migrations/009_complete_test_questions.sql
```

3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set a long random `JWT_SECRET` plus the MySQL credentials.

4. Create the default administrator account:

```powershell
npm run seed:admin
```

The default development credentials are `admin123` and `Admin12345$`. The password is stored as a bcrypt hash. The account uses `admin@fkams.local` for the default console OTP destination; change `ADMIN_EMAIL` before using a real OTP provider.

5. Start the API:

```powershell
npm start
```

The API listens on `http://localhost:4000` by default.

To deliver OTPs by email, configure `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`, and optionally `SMTP_FROM`/`SMTP_SECURE` in `.env`. Without SMTP settings, development OTPs are printed in the backend console.

Admission decisions notify the parent using the submitted phone number or email. Configure the same SMTP settings for email delivery. For SMS delivery, configure `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, and `TWILIO_FROM`; without a provider, the notification is printed in the backend console. Approved applicants receive their generated admission number as the student login username and a generated temporary password.

## OTP login

By default OTP is required for `admin`, `dos`, `parent`, `teacher`, `accountant` and `librarian`. The `student` role is excluded by default. Change `OTP_ROLES` in `.env` if the policy changes. Users in OTP roles need an email (default `OTP_CHANNEL=email`) or phone (with `OTP_CHANNEL=sms`).

For local development, `OTP_PROVIDER=console` prints the code in the backend terminal and never returns it in the HTTP response. A real email/SMS adapter must replace this provider before production; do not expose OTP codes through the frontend or API response.

## Security behavior

- Passwords are stored as bcrypt hashes; plain passwords are never persisted.
- JWTs expire after eight hours and protected routes require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- OTP codes are hashed, expire after five minutes by default, are single-use, and allow only five verification attempts.
- Role middleware blocks unauthorized modules.
- Teacher access is limited to assigned class/subject students.
- Parents can access only linked children; students can access only their own records.
- Test expiry is checked on the API, so changing the browser clock cannot extend a test.
- SQL values use parameterized queries.
- Helmet, restricted CORS, JSON size limits and login attempt throttling are enabled.

Automatic backups should be configured at the infrastructure level, for example with a scheduled `mysqldump` job and encrypted off-site storage. Do not commit `.env` or database backups.

The document endpoint stores metadata and a `storageKey`; connect that key to private object storage (or a protected file service) before production. The schema intentionally keeps file bytes outside MySQL.
